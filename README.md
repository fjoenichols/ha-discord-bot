# HA Discord Bot
Home Assistant's Discord Integration requires a bot user to send notifications to discord. I was unable to find one that was easily available to use, so I built one.  It's stupid simple. It can be ran as a docker image or directly from python. 

For all other setup steps for the Discord Integration with Home Assistant view the [Discord Integration Page](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/discord).
